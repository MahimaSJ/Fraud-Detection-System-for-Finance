In the dynamic financial industry, fraud is a significant and persistent challenge. Financial 
institutions and e-commerce platforms face billions in losses due to fraudulent activities such 
as credit card fraud and identity theft. Machine learning models, particularly fraud detection 
systems, have become essential tools in identifying and preventing such financial threats. 
This project focuses on developing a fraud detection system using machine learning, 
deployed as an interactive web app using Streamlit, a Python framework for building data 
applications.
